# HPRS
- HPRS is a pipeline to utilize epigenomic data from human for predicting functional regulatory genomic regions in cattle or other production animals. It can be used for possible improvement of pre/post GWAS analysis and genomic prediction models, and for understanding functional mechanisms of regulatory SNPs
