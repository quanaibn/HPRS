# HPRS (Human Projection of Regulatory Sequences) pipeline
#### HPRS is a computational pipeline that enables the utilization of genomic and epigenomic data from human genome to predict functional regulatory genomic regions in production animals and can be extended to other mammalian species. Results of the pipeline can contribute to improving pre/post GWAS analysis and genomic prediction models, and understanding functional mechanisms of regulatory elements and DNA variants.

#### The pipeline has been developed and tested by Dr. Quan Nguyen, Prof. Brian Dalrymple and colleagues. Comments are very welcome and can be sent to the emails: quan.nguyen@csiro.au (or quan.nguyen@imb.uq.edu.au) and brian.dalrymple@uwa.edu.au.

#### The HPRS pipeline has three main steps, which are arranged in this Bitbucket site into three  main folders in sequential order of the pipeline. The pipeline starts with programs in Map folder, then Filter folder, and then RegulatorySNP folder. Each of these folders contains all Python/R/Shell scripts needed for running the programs and step-by-step instructions.

#### One additional Data folder contains data for testing, and a table with information on URLs to download publically available data for use in the pipeline. The Utilities directory contain optional, common commands, convenient to run the pipeline.
